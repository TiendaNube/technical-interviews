# Fizz Buzz

## Goal

 * Write a program that returns an array with the numbers from 1 to given limit (inclusive).
 * But for multiples of three return “Fizz” instead of the number
 * For the multiples of five return “Buzz”.
 * For numbers which are multiples of both three and five return “FizzBuzz” instead.
