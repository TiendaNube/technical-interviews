# Reverse Words

Implement a python function that reverses each word within a sentence.

For example: 'this is a normal sentence' should be converted to 'siht si a lamron ecnetnes'

## Scope

Add your implementation in `Utils.java` so that every test defined in `ReverseWordsTest.java` passes.

## Run tests

`mvn clean package`
